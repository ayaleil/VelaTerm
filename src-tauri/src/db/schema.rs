/// `projects.deleted_at` / `groups.deleted_at` are soft-deletion tombstones. Deleting a group/project that still
/// contains archived sessions does not remove its row; it sets this timestamp as a hidden tombstone. `list_tree`
/// excludes it with `deleted_at IS NULL`, making it appear deleted while preserving archived sessions and allowing
/// their group/project to be restored with them (see archive document §2 and retention in `repo::delete_node`).
/// The tombstone is physically removed only after its final archived session is restored or permanently deleted.
///
/// `projects.mark` / `groups.mark` / `sessions.mark` hold an optional user-chosen emoji marker shown before the node
/// name in the sidebar and usable as a sidebar filter. The value is the emoji itself rather than an enumerated code,
/// so unknown values from a newer build round-trip unchanged; NULL or an empty string means unmarked.
