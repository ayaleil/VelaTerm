//! Handing a Git task to the agent of the session the panel is showing, instead of starting a
//! separate one: that agent already knows what it was working on, which is most of what resolving a
//! conflict or writing a commit message needs.
//!
//! A conversation-view session receives the request as an ordinary message through the same outbox
//! the composer uses, so it queues behind a running turn and shows up in the conversation. A
//! terminal session gets the text pasted into its input as a bracketed paste, without Enter: a TUI
//! has no message queue, so the user decides when to send it.
